# DAY-3
Today I built an optimized paginated API for streams using Express + MongoDB (Mongoose) with proper indexes, cursor-based pagination.

---
# What I Learned 
-Cursor Based Pagination
-Why skip based pagination is slow
-Seeding sample streams
-Tested with boundary cases on Postman(empty, invalid cursor).

---
# How to run
-For Seeding
```bash
npm run seed 
```
-To run the server
```bash
npm run dev
```
